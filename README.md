1. I used "experiment1.csv" for the assignment. The first part of the analysis was in the plot_data file, in which 2 graphs were made. The first one plotted the number of cells against the time, and it shows an exponential growth when N (the number of cells) is much smaller than K (the carrying capacity). This is because there were not a limiting amount of resources, and so the bacteria were able to grow exponentially until it reached this point. It then reaches equillibrium (a constant population size) at around 2500 minutes, with a carrying capacity of 6e+10. However, the second graph allows us to see the stages of this logistic growth more clearly, as it is a semi-log plot, where the x axis remains linear, but the y axis is log transformed. Because of this, the graph shows 2 linear relationships. The first is a positive linear relationship between the time and the log number of cells, and this is valid where approximately t < 1700 minutes. The second linear relationship is from where the population size levels off, from after where t > 2500 approximately, and this is where N = K.
  
  
   Because of the linear relationships shown by the second graph, we could fit linear models to each of the stages, to work out certain parameters. For the first linear
